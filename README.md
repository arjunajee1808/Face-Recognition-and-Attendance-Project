# Face-Recognition-and-Attendance-Project
Advancements in machine learning have been applying deeply and widely in
numerous fields. Face recognition is among the most productive image
processing applications and has a pivotal role in the technical field. This work
leverages machine learning methods and information systems to present a
framework for student attendance combining machine learning-based face
recognition algorithm and relational databases to store, recognize, and record
student attendance. The proposed method is tested on various scenarios and is
expected to apply in practical cases.
The investigation is done by Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for face
detection and by using cosine distance to recognize faces. The purpose of this
study is face recognition in real-time i.e. using a webcam, camera of the mobile
device, and from a photograph or from a set of faces tracked in a video. We
measured the distance between the landmarks and compared the test image with
different known encoded image landmarks in the recognition stage. Face
Recognition includes extracting features and then recognizing it, in any case, such
as brightness, transformations as translation, rotation, and scale image. HOG
algorithm is used to detect faces .
